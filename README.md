# Hello, Vibe

This is a place for me to explore and experiment with _vibe_ coding.
I love setting up projects. So, I am going to try and make a project template.
The technologies that I am going are listed below.

## Technologies

- Typescript
- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS

> [!QUESTION] Backend?
> What technologies should I have to make a functioning backend?

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
